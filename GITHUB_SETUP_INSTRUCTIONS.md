# 🚀 CREATE NEW GITHUB REPOSITORY

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `india-market-segmentation`
   - Description: `Data-driven market segmentation framework for India using SHRUG platform - 3-tier classification with ML prediction`
   - Visibility: ✅ Public (recommended for showcase)
   - ❌ **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands in PowerShell:

```bash
# Set the remote origin (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/india-market-segmentation.git

# Rename main branch to 'main' (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Alternative Repository Names (if needed)

If `india-market-segmentation` is taken, try:
- `india-market-analysis`
- `shrug-market-segmentation` 
- `india-business-intelligence`
- `market-segmentation-india`
- `india-economic-analysis`

## Step 4: Verify Upload

After pushing, your repository should contain:
- ✅ README.md with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Data cleaning scripts (EC98, EC05, EC13)
- ✅ Folder structure preserved with .gitkeep files
- ✅ Smart .gitignore excluding large data files
- ✅ Environment configuration
